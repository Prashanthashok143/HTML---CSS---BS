    About Me</div>
<p class="text-bg-secondary m-lg-5 m-5   ps-5  rounded-top-5  border border-5 " id="Myself">My name is Prashanth and I'm from Jangoan. Since it is my hometown I'm living in Jangoan for past 15 years.

    Coming to my education, I had completed my tenth standard with 8.2 CGPA and my intermediate with 8.8 CGPA, I had completed BSC[MSCs] with the aggregate 87 percentage in the stream of computer science.
    
    Coming to my Family Background, I'm from a nuclear family consists of 4 including me. My Father is Ashok who is working as a Farmer. And My mother is Maheswary and she is doing well as a housewife, I do also have an elder sibling, she is currently pursuing her MBA,she is very loving and supportive in nature.
    
    Coming to my self, I'm a good communicator and an adaptable person and gave me an ability to keep the team up together. As I said I'm an adaptable person, I can change my approaches according to the needs.
    
    In most of my spare time I prefer to learn new things, as a part of learning new things I recently started learning few vocabulary of Hindi ,Tamil and basics in html ,apart from this I would also love to spend my time with watching movies, listening music.
    
    Coming to my co-curricular activities, Public speaking is one of my most interested activity of all time, I have participated in many seminars and events conducted by our college in the past three years and stood first in many of them.
    
    coming to my skillset I can do good at C, python and with basics of Java, however I would love to code in python.
    
    And Currently my short term goal is to get a job in an Organization that enhances my skillset and gives me an ability to implement the knowledge I have gained through my graduation until now
    
    this is about myself . Thank you</p>
