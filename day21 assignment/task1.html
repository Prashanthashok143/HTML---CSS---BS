<h1>CSS Units</h1> 
<p>CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

    Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
    
    Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.</p>   
</div>
<div id="div2">
   <p id="absolute"> Absolute Lengths
   </p>
    The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
</div>

<div id="units">
<pre id="unitdescs">
<p id="unitdesc">    Unit    Description </p>

    cm	    centimeters
    mm	    millimeters
    in	    inches 
    px*     pixels 
    pt	    points 
    pc	    picas 
</pre>
</div>

<div id="div3">
   <p id="relative"> Relative Lengths</p>
    Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.
